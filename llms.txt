# Bible 2460

Bible 2460 is a free Bible verse clock app for iPhone. It maps every minute of the day to a Bible verse by matching the current time (hour:minute) to a chapter-and-verse reference — for example, 3:16 shows John 3:16, and 11:30 shows Genesis 11:30. The app delivers time-matched Scripture directly to the user's Home Screen via an iOS widget.

## What the Name Means

## How the Time-to-Verse Mapping Works

Each minute of the day (from 0:00 to 23:59) is mapped to one or more Bible verses by matching the hour and minute to a book's chapter and verse number. For example:

- 11:30 → Genesis 11:30
- 3:16 → John 3:16
- 23:01 → Psalm 23:1

When no exact chapter:verse match exists for a given time, the app displays a random verse from its curated pool.

- Offers extra-large typography designed for distance readability (desk clock use)
