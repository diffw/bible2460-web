      <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
      <p class="date">Effective date: February 23, 2026</p>

      <p>Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms") carefully before using the Bible 2460 application ("the App"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>

      <h2>1. License</h2>
      <p>Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for your personal, non-commercial purposes on any Apple device that you own or control, as permitted by the Apple App Store terms.</p>
      <p>This license does not allow you to use the App on any device that you do not own or control, and you may not distribute or make the App available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time.</p>

      <h2>2. Apple's Licensed Application End User License Agreement</h2>
      <p>The App is licensed, not sold, to you. Your use of the App is also subject to Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Licensed Application End User License Agreement</a> ("Apple EULA"). In the event of any conflict between these Terms and the Apple EULA, the Apple EULA shall govern to the extent of such conflict.</p>

      <h2>3. Scripture Content</h2>
      <p>All Bible translations bundled with the App are in the public domain. These include: KJV (English), CUV (Simplified Chinese), UNV (Traditional Chinese), Kougo (Japanese), Korean, Luther 1912 (German), Ostervald (French), Riveduta (Italian), Thai, and RV1909 (Spanish).</p>
      <p>Scripture texts are sourced from openly available datasets and are not subject to copyright restriction. We make no claim of ownership over these texts.</p>

      <h2>4. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions</h2>
      <p>The App may offer in-app purchases or auto-renewable subscriptions to access premium features. All transactions are processed by Apple through the App Store. By making a purchase, you agree to Apple's payment and subscription terms.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Subscription prices are displayed before purchase and may vary by region.</li>
        <li>Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
        <li>You can manage or cancel your subscription in your Apple ID account settings.</li>
        <li>No refunds are provided for the unused portion of any subscription period, except as required by applicable law or Apple's refund policy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>The App's design, code, user interface, graphics, logo, and all non-public-domain content are the intellectual property of Bible 2460 and are protected by applicable copyright and trademark laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, reverse-engineer, or create derivative works based on the App or any of its components.</p>

      <h2>6. Acceptable Use</h2>
      <p>You agree not to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the App for any unlawful or unauthorized purpose.</li>
        <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App.</li>
        <li>Remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices in the App.</li>
        <li>Use the App in any way that could damage, disable, or impair the App or interfere with any other party's use.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS.</p>

      <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL BIBLE 2460, ITS DEVELOPERS, OR ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE APP.</p>

      <h2>9. Third-Party Acknowledgment</h2>
      <p>You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and Bible 2460 only, and not with Apple. Bible 2460, not Apple, is solely responsible for the App and its content. Apple has no obligation to provide any maintenance or support services for the App.</p>
      <p>In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price (if any). To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation with respect to the App.</p>
      <p>Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the App, including product liability claims, any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement, and claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.</p>
      <p>Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms. Upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary.</p>

      <h2>10. Termination</h2>
      <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the App at any time, without prior notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users, us, or third parties. Upon termination, your license to use the App will immediately cease.</p>

      <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which Bible 2460 operates, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

      <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. When we do, we will revise the "Effective date" at the top of this page. Your continued use of the App after any changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
